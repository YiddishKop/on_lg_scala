hello world
This has caused a shitstorm on the Internet, 
media discussing the legality of it all, 
websites taking down the deepfake creations, 
and people panicking as they realise AI is going to screw us all up 
(newsflash: it's already been happening in much less obvious ways). 
And meanwhile, Nicolas Cage is taking over Hollywood.

While everyone's debating whether this is good or bad, 
I just had to find out more. First thing that came into my mind? 
How can I apply this to everyone I know (in a non-porn way, in case you wondered).
